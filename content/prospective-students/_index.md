        Information about the graduate programs (M.Sc., Ph.D.) can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/masters-programs/msc-geography/). The Geography Department typically requires students hold an M.Sc. degree before starting a Ph.D. program. Our M.Sc. degrees are 2 years long and our Ph.D. degrees are typically completed in 4-5 years.
        
        <b><u> Admissions Timeline: </u></b> The deadline for M.Sc. applications is typically around December 15th while the deadline for Ph.D. applications is around January 10th. Please check the [department website](https://geog.ubc.ca/graduate/) for up-to-date deadlines. If you are interested in applying, please reach out to Dr. Kuhn 3-12 months before the applications deadline. The earlier the better!
