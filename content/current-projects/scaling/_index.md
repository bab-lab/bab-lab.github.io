      - title: What's happening in the North?
        content: 'Anthropogenic use of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is warming the planet, altering the natural methane cycle. Understanding the magnitude of response of natural methane emissions from Northern ecosystems is critical towards quantifying the global methane budget and establishing emission reduction goals.'

      - title: How do we use scaling?
        content: 'Our group uses data synthesis and statistical scaling models to quantify the magnitude and drivers of methane emissions from boreal-Arctic ecosystems. <br>
        Examples of our research approaches include <br>
        1) developing better wetland and lake land cover maps to improve methane emission models, <br>
        2) synthesizing available field measurements of methane fluxes to determine environmental drivers of methane and decadal trends in methane emissions, and <br>
        3) quantifying methane emissions from the boreal-Arctic region using statistical modeling approaches. Most recently we have been working with collaborators from Woodwell Climate Research Center and the Max Planck Institute to develop the most comprehensive carbon dioxide and methane flux dataset for the boreal-Arctic region, to date.'
