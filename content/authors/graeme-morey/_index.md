I am pursuing a BSc in Natural Resources Conservation in the Faculty of Forestry. In this lab, I am assisting with soil sample processing and geoanalyzing historic aerial imagery to track treeline shifts in the Cassiar Mountains (Northern British Columbia). Prior to working in this lab, I have worked for industrial forestry in both the interior and coastal regions of BC, and for both marine conservation and wildfire labs at UBC. I look forward to the opportunity to work with the BAB lab on current and future projects.
