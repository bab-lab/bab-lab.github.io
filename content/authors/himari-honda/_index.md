I am a MSc student in the BAB lab and am interested in how climate change has been impacting Arctic greenhouse gas emissions and how accurate our current flux estimates are. I explore areas of data synthesis and scaling to improve current models and future prediction for emissions. To address these questions, I collaborate with researchers developing the most comprehensive Arctic-boreal carbon dioxide and methane flux dataset, to date. Some of my hobbies include baking, sudoku, and window shopping!
