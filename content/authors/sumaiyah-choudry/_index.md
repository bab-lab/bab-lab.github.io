I am an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia, studying Natural Resources Conservation with a Science and Management focus.
Previously, I worked at the Avil√®s Lab in the Biodiversity Research Centre, where I investigated spider body and web size across elevational gradients. At the BAB Lab, I am excited to explore how vegetation and ecosystem processes shape methane cycling in boreal and Arctic landscapes. I am particularly interested in how environmental change influences carbon dynamics across northern ecosystems.
Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring the outdoors.
