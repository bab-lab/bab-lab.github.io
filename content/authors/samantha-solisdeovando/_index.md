# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Samantha is conducting an undergraduate thesis, co-supervised by the Boreal-Arctic Biogeochemistry Lab (Department of Geography) and Team Shrub (Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences). I am investigating how experimental extended snow-free periods and heatwaves alter tundra plant phenology, morphology, and greenhouse gas cycling.

I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, completing my final year of a BA in Environment and Sustainability and English Literature. I am currently conducting an undergraduate thesis, co-supervised by the Boreal-Arctic Biogeochemistry Lab (Department of Geography) and Team Shrub (Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences). I am investigating how experimental extended snow-free periods and heatwaves alter tundra plant phenology, morphology, and greenhouse gas cycling. My research aims to quantify the impacts that futuristic climate extremes will have on real tundra plant communities, predict phenological and morphological shifts, and understand their influence on CO2. and CH4 cycling. Outside of school I am an avid cook, (recreational) boxing enthusiast, and Vancouver-explorer!
