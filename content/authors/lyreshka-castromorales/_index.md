As a Master’s student at the University of British Columbia, I work in northern British Columbia studying how climate change influences methane fluxes in upland tundra. My research focuses on how vegetation (mainly shrubs) interacts with warming temperatures, soil moisture, and nutrient availability to shape methane uptake and emissions. My aim is to understand how these rapidly changing landscapes contribute to, or help mitigate, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
I’m also passionate about making science accessible—whether through mentorship or creative outreach like zines, photography, and illustration. Through my work, I hope to bridge science, community, and creativity to foster more inclusive and grounded approaches to climate communication.
